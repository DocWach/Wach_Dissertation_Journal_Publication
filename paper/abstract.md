# Abstract

Verification models are fundamental to systems engineering practice, yet their definition remains largely qualitative, relying on heuristic assumptions about representativeness rather than scientific principles. This paper presents a systems theoretic metamodel for defining verification models through morphic equivalence relationships, grounded in the theoretical foundations of A. Wayne Wymore's computational systems theory, Tricotyledon Theory of System Design (T3SD), and Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS).

We demonstrate that verification models should be defined through a combination of systems theoretic relationships between verification artifacts: system requirements, system designs, verification requirements, and verification models. The research establishes that verification models are indirectly defined from system requirements through system designs and verification requirements. While verification models are expected to be morphically equivalent to corresponding system designs, infinite equivalence may exist and must be bounded through two mechanisms: (1) verification requirement problem spaces that characterize verification activity based on morphic equivalence to system requirements, and (2) verification model morphic conditions specifying desired equivalence between system designs and verification models.

The resulting Wymorian Systems Engineering (WySE) metamodel provides a science-based framework for verification model definition, advancing the discipline of systems engineering toward the analytical rigor characteristic of mature engineering fields. Validation against ISO 15288 and NASA verification practices confirms the unique contribution and practical applicability of this theoretical foundation.
