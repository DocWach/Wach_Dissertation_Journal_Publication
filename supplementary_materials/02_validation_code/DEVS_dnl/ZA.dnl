to start passivate in SA1!
when in SA1 and receive IoXA1 go to SA1!

external event for SA1 with IoXA1 
<%//Add your own code
Serializable variable = messageList.get(0).getData();%>!
when in SA1 and receive IoXA2 go to trans12!

external event for SA1 with IoXA2 
<%//Add your own code
Serializable variable = messageList.get(0).getData();%>!
hold in trans12 for time 0!
after trans12 output IoXA4!
from trans12 go to SA2!

output event for trans12  
<%//Add your own code
output.add(outIoXA4,null);%>!

internal event for trans12  
<%//place your own code for internal event here.%>!
